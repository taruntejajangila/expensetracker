4. Click **"Create Banner"** button
5. Fill in:
   - Banner Name: `Test Banner Cloudinary`
   - Description: `Testing Cloudinary upload`
   - Target URL: `https://example.com`
6. Click **"Upload a file"**

8. Wait for upload to complete
9. Click **"Create Banner"**

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Upload progress shows
- ✅ Image preview displays correctly in modal
- ✅ Mobile app preview shows the image
- ✅ Banner appears in banners list with thumbnail
- ✅ Railway logs show: `Image uploaded to Cloudinary: https://res.cloudinary.com/...`

```

---

### **Test 2: View Banner in Admin Panel Table**

**Objective:** Verify banner thumbnails display correctly in the list

**Steps:**
1. After creating a banner, stay on the **Banners** page

- ✅ Image loads quickly
- ✅ Image is properly sized (16x12 thumbnail)
- ✅ No console errors about failed image loads

**If Image Doesn't Load:**
- Right-click on broken image → "Inspect Element"
- Check the `src` attribute - should be: `https://res.cloudinary.com/...`
- Should NOT be: `https://expensetracker.../https://res.cloudinary...` (double URL)

---

### **Test 3: Edit Existing Banner**

**Objective:** Verify existing banner images load correctly in edit modal

**Steps:**
1. In banners table, click the **Edit** icon (pencil) on a banner
2. Edit modal opens
3. Scroll to "Image Preview" section

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Current image displays correctly
- ✅ Image preview section shows the Cloudinary image
- ✅ No "Failed to load image" message

🔍 HomeScreen: Transformed banners: [{ imageUrl: "https://res.cloudinary.com/..." }]
✅ HomeScreen: Banners loaded successfully
```

**If Image Doesn't Load:**
- Check Expo console for errors
- Look for the transformed banner `imageUrl` - should be: `https://res.cloudinary.com/...`

5. Refresh the banners page
6. Open mobile app and pull to refresh on home screen

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ All banner images still display correctly
- ✅ No broken images
- ✅ Images load from Cloudinary, not local storage

**Why This Test is Important:**
- Railway containers have ephemeral storage
- Local file uploads would be lost on restart
- Cloudinary images persist indefinitely

---

### **Test 6: Check Cloudinary Dashboard**

- ✅ Can see image transformations, size, format

---

### **Test 7: Upload Multiple Image Formats**

**Objective:** Verify Cloudinary handles different image formats

**Steps:**
1. Upload a banner with a **PNG** file
2. Upload a banner with a **JPG** file
3. Upload a banner with a **GIF** file (if supported)

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ All formats upload successfully
- ✅ All formats display correctly in admin panel

**Steps:**
1. In admin panel banners table, click **Delete** icon (trash) on a banner
2. Confirm deletion

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Banner is removed from database
- ✅ Banner no longer appears in admin panel list
- ✅ Banner no longer appears in mobile app
- ⚠️ Image may still exist in Cloudinary (unless backend implements deletion)

---

### **Test 10: Banner Toggle Active/Inactive**

**Objective:** Verify banner visibility toggle works

**Steps:**
1. Create a banner and make it **Active**
2. Verify it shows in mobile app
3. In admin panel, click **Toggle Status** (eye icon)
4. Set banner to **Inactive**
5. Refresh mobile app

**Expected Results:**

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting Guide**

### **Issue: Image shows broken/blank in admin panel**

**Possible Causes:**
1. Image URL is malformed (double URL prepending)
2. Cloudinary credentials are incorrect
3. CORS issue blocking Cloudinary domain

**Debug Steps:**
1. Right-click broken image → Inspect Element
2. Check `src` attribute value
3. Copy URL and open in new browser tab
4. If URL is malformed: Check `admin-panel/app/banners/page.tsx` line 288, 467, 691, 861
5. If URL works in browser but not in app: Check CORS settings

**Fix:**
- URL should be: `https://res.cloudinary.com/dbqkjbrdd/image/upload/...`
- Should NOT be: `https://expensetracker.../https://res.cloudinary...`

---

### **Issue: Image shows broken in mobile app**

**Possible Causes:**
1. Image URL is malformed
2. App is using cached old data
3. Network issue

**Debug Steps:**
1. Check Expo console logs
2. Look for: `🔍 HomeScreen: Transformed banners: [...]`
3. Verify `imageUrl` starts with `https://res.cloudinary.com/`
4. Pull to refresh in app
5. Clear app data and relaunch

**Fix:**
- Check `ExpenseTrackerExpo/screens/HomeScreen.tsx` lines 96-100
- Should detect full URLs and not prepend server URL

---

### **Issue: Upload fails with "Invalid Signature"**

**Possible Causes:**
1. Cloudinary API Secret is incorrect
2. Extra spaces in environment variables
3. Transformations causing signature mismatch

**Debug Steps:**
1. Go to Railway backend logs
2. Check: `API Secret Length: 27 chars` (should be 27)
3. Verify all 3 Cloudinary env vars are set correctly
4. No spaces before/after values

**Fix:**
1. Go to Railway backend service → Variables
2. Delete and re-add: `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`
3. Copy EXACT value from Cloudinary dashboard (no spaces!)
4. Restart backend service

---

### **Issue: Upload succeeds but image doesn't persist after Railway restart**

**Possible Causes:**
1. Image uploaded to local storage, not Cloudinary
2. Cloudinary upload failed, fell back to local storage

**Debug Steps:**
1. Check Railway logs during upload
2. Should see: `Image uploaded to Cloudinary: https://res.cloudinary.com/...`
3. If you see: `Using local storage fallback`, Cloudinary failed

**Fix:**
- Verify Cloudinary credentials in Railway
- Check Cloudinary account is active (not suspended/quota exceeded)
- Check Railway backend logs for Cloudinary errors

---

### **Issue: Slow image loading in mobile app**

**Possible Causes:**
1. Large unoptimized images
2. Slow network connection
3. Cloudinary transformations not applied

**Debug Steps:**
1. Check image URL - should include transformations:
   ```
   https://res.cloudinary.com/dbqkjbrdd/image/upload/c_limit,h_630,w_1200/q_auto:good/f_auto/...
   ```
2. Check actual image file size in Cloudinary dashboard

**Fix:**
- Cloudinary should auto-optimize
- Transformations are applied via URL in `backend-api/src/config/cloudinary.ts`
- Verify transformation params are correct

---

## ✅ **Success Criteria**

All tests pass if:

1. ✅ **Upload Works:** Can upload images via admin panel without errors
2. ✅ **Images Persist:** Images survive Railway container restarts
3. ✅ **Display Works:** Images show correctly in both admin panel and mobile app
4. ✅ **URLs Correct:** Image URLs start with `https://res.cloudinary.com/`
5. ✅ **Performance Good:** Images load quickly (optimized by Cloudinary)
6. ✅ **No Console Errors:** No image load errors in browser or Expo console
7. ✅ **Cloudinary Dashboard:** Images visible in Cloudinary Media Library
