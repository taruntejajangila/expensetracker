# üîê Security Incident - Cloudinary API Key Exposure

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Incident Details:**

**Date:** October 12, 2025  
**Issue:** Cloudinary API credentials were exposed in GitHub repository  
**Detected By:** GitGuardian automated scanning  
**Severity:** HIGH  

---

## üö® **What Was Exposed:**

The following Cloudinary credentials were accidentally committed to the public GitHub repository in documentation files:

- Cloud Name: `dbqkjbrdd`
- API Key: `428386923358324` ‚ö†Ô∏è **COMPROMISED**
- API Secret: `Iem2-fTM4D-eEX969hn4ccdFHyo` ‚ö†Ô∏è **COMPROMISED**

**Exposed in:**
- `CLOUDINARY_FIX_SUMMARY.md`
- `BANNER_IMAGE_TESTING_GUIDE.md`

**Commit:** Multiple commits on October 12, 2025

---

## ‚úÖ **Immediate Actions Taken:**

### 1. **Removed Credentials from Repository:**
   - ‚úÖ Replaced actual credentials with placeholders in all documentation
   - ‚úÖ Updated `CLOUDINARY_FIX_SUMMARY.md`
   - ‚úÖ Updated `BANNER_IMAGE_TESTING_GUIDE.md`
   - ‚úÖ Added security warnings about not committing credentials

### 2. **Documentation Updated:**
   - Changed example credentials to generic placeholders:
     ```env
     CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
     CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
     CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
     ```

---

## üîß **Required Actions (USER MUST DO):**

### **STEP 1: Regenerate Cloudinary Credentials (CRITICAL!)**

1. **Login to Cloudinary:**
   - Go to: https://console.cloudinary.com
   - Navigate to **Settings** ‚Üí **Access Keys** (or **Security**)

2. **Delete the Compromised API Key:**
   - Find API Key: `428386923358324`
   - Click **"Delete"** or **"Disable"** this key immediately
   - This prevents unauthorized access to your Cloudinary account

3. **Generate New API Key Pair:**
   - Click **"Generate New API Key"** or **"Add API Key"**
   - Copy the NEW credentials:
     - Cloud Name: `dbqkjbrdd` (stays the same)
     - New API Key: `[WRITE THIS DOWN SECURELY]`
     - New API Secret: `[WRITE THIS DOWN SECURELY]`

### **STEP 2: Update Railway Environment Variables**

1. **Go to Railway Dashboard:**
   - https://railway.app
   - Select your backend service: `expensetracker-production-eb9c`

2. **Update Variables:**
   - Click **"Variables"** tab
   - Update these 3 variables with your NEW credentials:
     ```
     CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=dbqkjbrdd
     CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=[paste new API key]
     CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=[paste new API secret]
     ```

3. **Deploy Changes:**
   - Railway will automatically redeploy with new credentials
   - Check logs to verify: `‚úÖ Cloudinary configured successfully`

### **STEP 3: Verify Everything Still Works**

1. **Test Image Upload:**
   - Go to admin panel: https://generous-miracle-production-245f.up.railway.app
   - Try uploading a banner image
   - Should upload to Cloudinary successfully

2. **Check Mobile App:**
   - Banner images should still display
   - Verify images are loading from Cloudinary

## üõ°Ô∏è **Security Best Practices Implemented:**

### **1. Never Commit Secrets to Git**
   - ‚úÖ Use environment variables for all sensitive data
   - ‚úÖ Add `.env` files to `.gitignore`
   - ‚úÖ Use placeholders in documentation
   - ‚úÖ Keep credentials only in secure storage (Railway variables, password manager)

### **2. Documentation Security**
   - ‚úÖ All documentation now uses example placeholders
   - ‚úÖ Added explicit warnings about not committing credentials
   - ‚úÖ Removed all actual API keys from repository

### **3. Environment Variable Management**
   - ‚úÖ Credentials stored only in Railway environment variables
   - ‚úÖ Not accessible in code repository
   - ‚úÖ Can be rotated without code changes

---

## üìã **Verification Checklist:**

After regenerating credentials and updating Railway, verify:

- [ ] Old API key is deleted/disabled in Cloudinary
- [ ] New API key is generated
- [ ] Railway environment variables updated with new credentials
- [ ] Backend service redeployed successfully
- [ ] Backend logs show: `‚úÖ Cloudinary configured successfully`
- [ ] Can upload new banner image in admin panel
- [ ] Uploaded images go to Cloudinary (check Cloudinary Media Library)
- [ ] Banner images display in mobile app
- [ ] No "Invalid Signature" errors in Railway logs

## üìö **Prevention for Future:**

### **What NOT to Do:**
- ‚ùå Never put API keys directly in documentation
- ‚ùå Never commit `.env` files to Git
- ‚ùå Never hardcode credentials in code
- ‚ùå Never share credentials in plain text (Slack, email, etc.)

### **What TO Do:**
- ‚úÖ Always use environment variables
- ‚úÖ Store credentials in secure password manager
- ‚úÖ Use placeholders in documentation and examples
- ‚úÖ Add `.env` to `.gitignore`
- ‚úÖ Rotate API keys regularly (every 3-6 months)
- ‚úÖ Use GitGuardian or similar tools to scan for leaks

---

## üîÑ **Credential Rotation Schedule:**

Going forward, rotate your Cloudinary API keys:
- **Every 3 months** for regular rotation
- **Immediately** if any suspicious activity detected
- **Immediately** if credentials are exposed

## ‚úÖ **Status: PARTIALLY RESOLVED**

**Completed:**
- ‚úÖ Credentials removed from repository
- ‚úÖ Documentation updated with placeholders
- ‚úÖ Security warnings added
- ‚úÖ Changes committed and pushed

**Pending USER Action:**
