# 🔍 Loan Files Comparison - Cloud vs Local

**Date:** October 21, 2025  
**Status:** Verifying loan functionality

---

## ✅ **Files Status:**

### **Backend Loan Service:**
**File:** `backend-api/src/services/loanService.ts`

**Git Status:** ✅ Pushed to origin/master (commit b4c41a9)

**Column Names Used (Correct):**
- ✅ `loan_name` (NOT `name`)
- ✅ `principal_amount` (NOT `amount`)
- ✅ `loan_term_months` (NOT `term_months` or `termMonths`)
- ✅ `outstanding_balance` (NOT `remaining_balance`)
- ✅ `is_active` (NOT `status`)

**Verification:**
```bash
git diff origin/master backend-api/src/services/loanService.ts
# Result: No differences - files are identical ✅
```

---

### **Mobile App Loan Service:**
**File:** `ExpenseTrackerExpo/services/LoanService.ts`

**Git Status:** ✅ Pushed to origin/master (commit b4c41a9)

**Interest Rate Handling:** ✅ Fixed (sends percentage, not decimal)
```typescript
// Removed incorrect conversion:
// interestRate: loan.interestRate > 1 ? loan.interestRate / 100 : loan.interestRate

// Now sends:
interestRate: loan.interestRate // 26 for 26%
```

**Verification:**
```bash
git diff origin/master ExpenseTrackerExpo/services/LoanService.ts
# Result: No differences - files are identical ✅
```

---

### **Compiled Backend Code:**
**File:** `backend-api/dist/services/loanService.js`

**Column Names:** ✅ Correct
- ✅ Uses `loan_name`, `principal_amount`, `loan_term_months`, `outstanding_balance`, `is_active`

**Build Status:** ✅ Up to date (compiled from latest source)

---

## 🔍 **Railway Deployment Status:**

### **Latest Commit on Railway:**
```bash
Commit: b4c41a9
Message: "fix: Loan service schema alignment and Railway deployment optimizations"

```

### **Railway Logs Show:**

## 🚀 **Railway Build Check:**

To verify Railway deployed the latest code, check:

1. **Railway Dashboard:**
   - Go to: https://railway.app/project/selfless-vibrancy
   - Check "Deployments" tab
   - Latest deployment should be from commit `b4c41a9`

2. **Deployment Logs:**
   - Should show successful build
   - Build time: ~2-3 minutes with Nixpacks
   - Health check: Should pass at `/health`

---

## 🧪 **Testing Loan Creation:**

### **From Mobile App:**

**Test Steps:**
1. Open mobile app
2. Navigate to "Loans" screen
3. Tap "Add Loan" or "+"
4. Fill in details:
   - Loan Name: `Test Car Loan`
   - Loan Type: `Auto`
   - Principal Amount: `20000`
   - Interest Rate: `26` (for 26%)
   - Loan Term: `24` months
   - Start Date: Today
   - Lender: `Test Bank`
5. Tap "Save"

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Loan created successfully
- ✅ Loan appears in loans list
- ✅ Interest rate shows: 26%
- ✅ EMI calculated: ~₹1,070-1,100
- ✅ Outstanding balance: ₹20,000

## ❓ **What's the Issue?**

Please provide:
1. **What happens** when you try to create a loan?
2. **Error message** displayed (if any)
3. **Console logs** from mobile app
4. **Backend logs** (if running locally)

---

## 🔧 **Possible Issues & Solutions:**

### Issue 1: "Loans not loading"
**Symptom:** Loans screen shows loading or empty
**Solution:** Check mobile app logs for API errors

### Issue 2: "Cannot create loan"
**Symptom:** Error when submitting loan form
**Solutions:**
- Check if all required fields are filled
- Verify interest rate is a number (26, not "26%")
- Check mobile app console for error details

### Issue 3: "Interest rate showing 0%"
**Symptom:** Loan card shows 0% interest
**Status:** ✅ Should be fixed in commit b4c41a9
**Verify:** Mobile app using cloud mode (`FORCE_CLOUD_MODE = true`)

### Issue 4: "Loan not appearing after creation"
**Symptom:** Loan created but not in list
**Solutions:**
- Pull to refresh the loans list
- Check if loan was actually created (backend logs)
- Verify user authentication (correct user logged in)

---

## 🎯 **Verification Steps:**

### **1. Verify Railway Deployment:**
```bash
railway logs --service expensetracker | grep -i "loan\|error"
```

### **2. Verify Local Build:**
```bash
cd backend-api
npm run build
# Check for any TypeScript errors
```

### **3. Test Loan Creation Locally:**
```bash
# Start local backend
npm run dev

# In mobile app, set FORCE_CLOUD_MODE = false
# Try creating a loan
# Check console logs
```
