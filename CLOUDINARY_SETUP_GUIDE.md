# 📸 Cloudinary Setup Guide

## Why Cloudinary?

Railway containers are **ephemeral** - files uploaded to the local filesystem are **deleted when Railway restarts**. This causes banner images to disappear.

**Cloudinary** provides permanent cloud storage for images that persists forever, regardless of Railway restarts.

## 🚀 Quick Setup (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Create Free Cloudinary Account

1. Go to https://cloudinary.com/users/register_free
2. Click **"Sign Up for Free"**
3. Fill in your details:
   - Email
   - Password
   - Choose a **Cloud Name** (e.g., `expensetracker-yourname`)
4. Verify your email
5. Log in to Cloudinary Dashboard

### Step 2: Get Your API Credentials

1. In **Cloudinary Dashboard**, you'll see:
   ```
   Cloud name: your-cloud-name
   API Key: 123456789012345
   API Secret: AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUvWxYz
   ```

2. **Copy these 3 values** - you'll need them in the next step

### Step 3: Add to Railway Environment Variables

1. Go to **Railway Dashboard**
2. Click your **backend service** (`expensetracker-production-eb9c`)
3. Click **Variables** tab
4. Click **"New Variable"** and add these 3 variables:

```
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=123456789012345
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUvWxYz
```

**Replace the values** with your actual Cloudinary credentials from Step 2.

4. Railway will **automatically restart** the backend with the new variables
