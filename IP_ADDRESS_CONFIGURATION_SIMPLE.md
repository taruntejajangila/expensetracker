# 🎯 Simple Answer: IP Address Configuration

## ❓ **Your Question:**
> "I have to change IP every time? For development I am using my local address, but in cloud it will be different right?"

---

## ✅ **Answer: NO! You DON'T Have to Change It Every Time!**

---

## 🔧 **How It Works Now:**

### **1. Local Development (When you're coding):**
```
You run: npm start
App uses: http://192.168.29.14:5000/api (YOUR COMPUTER)
Automatically! ✅
```

### **2. Production (When users download your app):**
```
You build: npx expo build:android
App uses: https://your-backend.railway.app/api (RAILWAY CLOUD)
Automatically! ✅
```

---

## 📝 **You Only Need to Update TWO Times:**

### **Time 1: When You Change Your Local IP** (rarely)
```typescript
File: ExpenseTrackerExpo/config/api.config.ts
Line 7: const LOCAL_API_URL = 'http://YOUR-NEW-IP:5000/api';
```

### **Time 2: When You Deploy to Railway** (once)
```typescript
File: ExpenseTrackerExpo/config/api.config.ts
Line 10: const PRODUCTION_API_URL = 'https://your-backend.railway.app/api';
```

---

## 🚀 **After That:**

✅ During development → Uses local automatically  
✅ When building APK → Uses Railway automatically  
✅ **NO MORE MANUAL CHANGES!**

---

## 💡 **The Magic:**

The app detects if it's in **development mode** or **production build** and switches automatically:

```typescript
// This line does all the magic:
export const API_BASE_URL = __DEV__ ? LOCAL_API_URL : PRODUCTION_API_URL;

// __DEV__ = true when you run npm start
// __DEV__ = false when you build APK
```

## 📋 **Summary:**

| Scenario | What App Uses | Do You Change? |
|----------|--------------|----------------|
| **Daily coding** | Local IP | ❌ No |
| **Testing on phone** | Local IP | ❌ No |
| **Building APK** | Railway URL | ❌ No |
| **Users download app** | Railway URL | ❌ No |

**You only change when:**
1. Your WiFi IP changes (rare)
2. You first deploy to Railway (once)

---

## ✨ **Before This Fix:**
```
Every time you switch between local and cloud:
- Open AuthContext.tsx
- Change URL manually
- Open 10+ other files
- Change URL manually in each
- Easy to forget one
- Lots of errors ❌
```

## ✨ **After This Fix:**
```
Just code normally:
- npm start → uses local ✅
- Build APK → uses cloud ✅
- Everything automatic!
```

**That's it! You're all set!** 🎉
