## 💡 Best Practices

### When to Show Native Ads:
- ✅ In lists (every 5-10 items)
- ✅ In grids (every 4-6 items)
- ✅ Between logical breaks (after middle item)
- ✅ Where users scroll naturally

### When NOT to Show:
- ❌ On empty states
- ❌ During onboarding
- ❌ More than 1 ad per screen view
- ❌ Too frequent (user experience matters!)
