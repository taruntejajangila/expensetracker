# AdMob Development Build Status

## ‚úÖ Configuration Complete

All files are configured for AdMob with react-native-google-mobile-ads:

1. ‚úÖ `react-native-google-mobile-ads` installed
2. ‚úÖ `app.json` configured with AdMob plugin
3. ‚úÖ `AdMobService.ts` updated with real implementation
4. ‚úÖ `AdMobComponents.tsx` updated with real banner ads
5. ‚úÖ `eas.json` ready for development builds

## üöÄ To Create Development Build

### Option 1: EAS Cloud Build (Recommended)

Since you're on Windows without Android SDK, use EAS cloud builds:

```bash
# Create development build
eas build --platform android --profile development

# This will build in the cloud and give you a download link
# Takes about 10-15 minutes
```

### Option 2: Android Studio (Local Build)

1. Install Android Studio with Android SDK
2. Set `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable
3. Run: `npx expo prebuild` to generate Android project
4. Run: `npx expo run:android` to build and run

### Option 3: Use Physical Device

Connect your Android phone and run:
```bash
npx expo run:android
```

## üì± Current Status

- **Expo Go**: Shows placeholder ads (mock implementation)
- **Development Build**: Will show real Google test ads
- **Production Build**: Will show your real AdMob ads

## üîß Next Steps

1. Create development build with EAS:
   ```bash
   eas build --platform android --profile development
   ```

2. Download and install the APK on your Android device

3. Test the ads - Google test ads will appear

4. When ready for production, update ad unit IDs and create production build:
   ```bash
   eas build --platform android --profile production
   ```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- Development builds allow testing real ads locally
- Google test ads are used automatically in development builds
- Production ads require real ad unit IDs from AdMob console
- Ads only work in development/production builds, NOT in Expo Go
