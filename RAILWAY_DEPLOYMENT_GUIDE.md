**Deployment Platform**: Railway  
**Cost**: $5/month (Hobby Plan)

---

## üìã **Overview**

We'll deploy in this order:
1. ‚úÖ Push code to GitHub
2. ‚úÖ Deploy Backend API to Railway
3. ‚úÖ Deploy Admin Panel to Railway (or Vercel)
4. ‚úÖ Update Mobile App with production URLs
5. ‚úÖ Build Mobile App APK

**Total Time**: ~30-45 minutes

## üîê **STEP 1: Push to GitHub**

### **1.1: Create GitHub Repository**

1. Go to https://github.com
2. Click "New repository" (green button)
3. Repository name: `expense-tracker` (or your choice)
4. Choose: **Private** (recommended)
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README (you already have code)
6. Click "Create repository"

### **1.2: Push Your Code**

**In your terminal:**

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd /d/expensetracker-1

# Add GitHub as remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/expense-tracker.git

# Push your code
git push -u origin master
```

**If you get an error about authentication:**
```bash
# You'll need to create a Personal Access Token:
# 1. Go to: GitHub ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Developer settings ‚Üí Personal access tokens ‚Üí Tokens (classic)
# 2. Generate new token (classic)
# 3. Select: repo (full control)
# 4. Copy the token

## üöÇ **STEP 2: Deploy Backend API to Railway**

### **2.1: Create Railway Account**

1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Click "Start a New Project"
3. Login with GitHub (recommended)
4. Authorize Railway to access your repositories

### **2.2: Create New Project**

1. Click "New Project"
2. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Choose your `expense-tracker` repository
4. Railway will detect it's a monorepo

### **2.3: Configure Backend Service**

**Important**: You need to tell Railway which folder to deploy

1. After selecting repo, Railway starts detecting
2. Click on the deployment
3. Go to **Settings** tab
4. Find **"Root Directory"**
5. Set to: `backend-api`
6. Find **"Start Command"**
7. Set to: `npm run dev` (for testing) or `npm start` (for production with build)

### **2.4: Add Environment Variables**

In Railway dashboard:

1. Click on your backend service
2. Go to **Variables** tab
3. Click "New Variable"
4. Add these one by one:

```env
# Database (Railway will provide this)
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=5000

# Database - You'll set up PostgreSQL next
DB_HOST=
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=expense_tracker_db
DB_USER=
DB_PASSWORD=

# JWT Secrets (IMPORTANT: Change these!)
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=24h
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=your-refresh-secret-change-this-too
JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRES_IN=7d

# App URLs (will be provided by Railway)
MOBILE_APP_URL=exp://your-expo-url
ADMIN_PANEL_URL=https://your-admin-panel-url
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-admin-panel-url

# Server URL (Railway will provide domain)
SERVER_URL=https://your-backend.railway.app

# File Upload
MAX_FILE_SIZE=5242880
UPLOAD_PATH=./uploads
ALLOWED_FILE_TYPES=image/jpeg,image/png,image/gif,application/pdf
```

### **2.5: Add PostgreSQL Database**

1. In Railway dashboard, click "New"
2. Select "Database"
3. Choose "PostgreSQL"
4. Railway creates database and provides connection details
5. Copy these values to your backend environment variables:
   - `DB_HOST`
   - `DB_PORT`
   - `DB_NAME`
   - `DB_USER`
   - `DB_PASSWORD`

**OR use the DATABASE_URL:**
```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/database
```

### **2.6: Get Your Backend URL**

1. After deployment completes, Railway assigns a URL
2. Go to **Settings** tab
3. Find "Domains"
4. Copy your URL (e.g., `https://your-backend-production.up.railway.app`)
5. Add `/api` to use it (e.g., `https://your-backend-production.up.railway.app/api`)

### **2.7: Update SERVER_URL**

1. Go back to **Variables** tab
2. Update `SERVER_URL` with your Railway domain
3. Example: `SERVER_URL=https://your-backend-production.up.railway.app`

### **2.8: Test Backend**

```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl https://your-backend-production.up.railway.app/api/health

# Should return: {"status":"ok","timestamp":"..."}
```

## üñ•Ô∏è **STEP 3: Deploy Admin Panel**

You have 2 options:

### **Option A: Railway (Recommended)**

1. In Railway dashboard, click "New"
2. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Choose your `expense-tracker` repository again
4. In **Settings**:
   - Root Directory: `admin-panel`
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Start Command: `npm start`
5. Add environment variable:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-backend-production.up.railway.app/api
   ```
6. Deploy and get your admin panel URL

### **Option B: Vercel (Free, Better for Next.js)**

1. Go to https://vercel.com
2. Login with GitHub
3. Click "New Project"
4. Import your `expense-tracker` repository
5. Configure:
   - Framework: Next.js
   - Root Directory: `admin-panel`
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `.next`
6. Add environment variable:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-backend-production.up.railway.app/api
   ```
7. Deploy

## üì± **STEP 4: Update Mobile App**

### **4.1: Update Config File**

Edit: `ExpenseTrackerExpo/config/api.config.ts`

```typescript
// Line 10: Update with your Railway backend URL
const PRODUCTION_API_URL = 'https://your-backend-production.up.railway.app/api';
```

### **4.2: Commit Changes**

```bash
git add ExpenseTrackerExpo/config/api.config.ts
git commit -m "Update production API URL"
git push
```

---

## üì¶ **STEP 5: Build Mobile App APK**

### **5.1: Install EAS CLI**

```bash
npm install -g eas-cli
```

### **5.2: Login to Expo**

```bash
cd ExpenseTrackerExpo
eas login
```

### **5.3: Configure EAS Build**

```bash
eas build:configure
```

### **5.4: Build Android APK**

```bash
# For APK (directly installable)
eas build --platform android --profile preview

# For AAB (Google Play Store)
eas build --platform android --profile production
```

**This will:**
1. Upload your code to Expo servers
2. Build the APK in the cloud
3. Provide a download link

### **5.5: Download and Test**

1. Wait for build to complete (~10-15 minutes)
2. Download APK from the link provided
3. Install on Android device
4. Test app functionality

---

## üîß **STEP 6: Database Setup**

### **6.1: Run Migrations**

You need to create database tables. Connect to Railway PostgreSQL:

**Option A: Use Railway CLI**
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login
railway login

# Link to your project
railway link

# Run migrations (if you have migration scripts)
railway run npm run db:migrate
```

**Option B: Use Database Client**

1. Get database credentials from Railway
2. Use pgAdmin, DBeaver, or TablePlus
3. Connect to database
4. Run your SQL schema file

**Option C: Create Tables Manually**

If you don't have migration scripts, you need to create tables. Here's a quick script:

```bash
# In backend-api directory, create this file:
# scripts/setup-production-db.js
```

Then run:
```bash
railway run node scripts/setup-production-db.js
```

---

## ‚úÖ **STEP 7: Verification**

### **7.1: Test Backend**

```bash
# Health check
curl https://your-backend.railway.app/api/health

# Test registration
curl -X POST https://your-backend.railway.app/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Test User",
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "password": "Test123456"
  }'
```

### **7.2: Test Admin Panel**

1. Open: `https://your-admin-panel.vercel.app`
2. Login with admin credentials
3. Check dashboard loads
4. Test user management

### **7.3: Test Mobile App**

1. Install APK on Android device
2. Register a new account
3. Add a transaction
4. Check if data saves

---

## üì± **Alternative: Expo Application Services (EAS)**

For mobile app distribution:

### **Option 1: Direct APK**
- Build with EAS
- Host APK file on your website
- Users download and install manually

### **Option 2: Google Play Store**
- Build AAB with EAS
- Create Google Play Developer account ($25 one-time)
- Submit app for review
- Users install from Play Store

### **Option 3: Internal Testing**
- Use Expo Go app for testing
- Share QR code with testers
- No build needed

---

## üö® **Troubleshooting**

### **Backend won't start:**
```bash
# Check logs in Railway dashboard
# Common issues:
- Missing environment variables
- Database connection failed
- Port conflict (Railway assigns PORT automatically)
```

### **Admin Panel can't connect:**
```bash
# Check NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL is correct
# Must include /api at the end
# Must be HTTPS (Railway provides this)
```

### **Mobile App can't connect:**
```bash
# Check config/api.config.ts
# Make sure PRODUCTION_API_URL is correct
# Rebuild APK after changes
```

### **Database connection fails:**
```bash
# Verify DATABASE_URL or individual DB_* variables
# Check database is running in Railway
# Test connection with database client
```
